        <h1>Intro-Questions</h1>

        <p>1. My name is Cloud. My major is architecture.
            I am currently a senior student.
        <br>2. I am taking a minor in CSI and I hope to learn some 
        website making knowledge in this class.
        <br>3. I know a bit about programming but not much about
        website making.
        <br>4. I hope to learn more about website making skills,
        both from aesthetics and programming. 
        <br>5. I think design for screen will include more interactive
        elements and visual changes than design for paper.
        <br>6. <b>www.gucci.com</b> I think this website meet my expectation
        about how a successful commercial website should look like in addition to fashion design.
        <br>7. <b>https://www.etc.cmu.edu/</b> I think this website
        clearly conveys information about the etc program in cmu and how to apply for it.
        <br>8. <b>https://www.google.com/</b> As the world largest search engine, it has been running for decades 
        and it's likely going to run forever.
