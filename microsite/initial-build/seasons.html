                    The fourth and final season of Attack on Titan begins with a time jump of several years into the future, showing that the world has changed dramatically since the previous season. The story now focuses on the conflict between the nation of Marley and the Eldian people living on the island of Paradis, who possess the power of the Titans.

                    The season introduces new main characters, including Gabi and Falco, who are candidates to inherit the Armored Titan and the Jaw Titan, respectively. The story follows their experiences as soldiers in the Marleyan military, as well as the Eldian resistance on Paradis Island, led by familiar characters like Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert.

                    Throughout the season, we see the consequences of the events from the previous seasons and how they have shaped the characters and the world they inhabit. The story explores themes of war, racism, and the cost of violence, while also introducing new mysteries and revelations about the history of the Titans and the world they live in.
                    <br><br>
                    As the season progresses, tensions rise between Marley and Paradis, leading to a full-scale war that threatens to engulf both nations. The season ends with a cliffhanger as Eren unleashes a devastating attack on Marley's capital city, leaving the fate of many characters uncertain and setting up the final part of the season for an epic conclusion.
